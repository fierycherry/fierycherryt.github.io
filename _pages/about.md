About me
======
I am an enthusiastic political scientist and (wannabe) data scientist with a great passion for teaching and a strong background in quantitative and qualitative research methods. Throughout my academic journey, I have enjoyed working at diverse institutions in Brazil and the UK, including the University of Brasilia, the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, the Federal University of Sao Carlos, Queen Mary University, and Aston University. I believe in alternative teaching methods and a more equalitarian education system to foster critical thinking and autonomy.

Beyond academia, I held several managerial positions at the Ministry of Culture of Brazil, becoming a strong advocate for evidence-based policies (although ideologies and politics are inevitable). I worked at the Department of Intellectual Rights and was responsible for international negotiations and monitoring Collective Management Organisations. In addition to providing technical advice to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I joined bilateral negotiations directly. I also organised multilateral events, including a meeting for Portuguese-speaking countries in collaboration with the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). I am passionate about music and literature and have extensive experience working with creative industries. 

My previous post-doctoral project led me to a long journey towards data science. Since then, I have focused on programming languages and their application to social science applied research, especially to make better public decisions.

I chair the International Political Science Association's research committee on politics and business and was a co-editor of the Agenda Politica (Political Agenda) journal.

In my spare time, I am a convict nerd, a huge Star Wars fan, a non-talented dancer, and a kickboxing fighter.
